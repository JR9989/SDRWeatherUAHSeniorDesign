Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Boston/Norton MA
1041 AM EDT Mon Apr 24 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
Low clouds this morning slowly lift and will give way to some
breaks of sunshine this afternoon. A spot shower or two is
possible across the interior today. More widespread hit-or- 
miss showers on Tuesday. This unsettled weather pattern
continues into Wed and Thu, with cool temperatures and 
isolated/widely scattered diurnal showers. Not a washout with 
many hours of dry weather each day. Driest stretch of weather 
may come Friday and Saturday, as Canadian High pressure builds 
east of New England, although likely remaining slightly cooler 
than normal. The next chance of widespread rain arrives sometime
Sunday or next Monday.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
1030 AM Update: 

Cloud bases associated with stratus are beginning to
lift/scatter a bit now that some albeit modest diurnal heating 
is underway, a trend indicated in NAM/RAP/HRRR BUFKIT profiles.
Expect that trend to continue today with llvl lapse rates
flipping from inverted to slightly unstable; however breaks in 
sun should prove destructive given cooler pocket of air aloft 
and that leftover llvl moisture around should force an 
increasing coverage of stratocu as stratus disperses. All told,
more clouds than sun; there may be some spotty sprinkles or very
light SHRA at worst but drier sub-cloud layer should make that
the exception vs the rule and several hrs of dry wx is
anticipated. 

Kept temps as is for now, but may need to consider lowering
these across eastern/southeast New England pending trends in sky
cover. Highs should be more common in the 50s, though we may see
a couple spot 60 degree readings.

Previous discussion:

Highlights

* Any lingering fog lifts by mid morning. More clouds than
  sunshine north of the MA Pike. Southern areas will start off
  sunny with increasing cloudiness this afternoon. Localized sea
  breezes across eastern areas. 

* Isolated rain showers across the interior this afternoon.

A broad cutoff low will be situated over the Great Lakes and
Ontario through the day. A shortwave trough will lift from the
Mid Atlantic/eastern Great Lakes this morning into New England
by late this afternoon/early evening. A broad surface low will
be over New England today. 

Dry slot punches into our region today, which should bring
enough sunshine to lift stratus/fog this AM. We will be stuck
under a fair amount of cloudiness given the shortwave lifting
in. There is not a whole lot of moisture to work with other than
in the lower levels, so am not expecting shower activity to be
too widespread. Think the best opportunities will be found
across the interior as the -20 to -25 degree Celsius 500 hPa
cold pool pushes in during the afternoon. Leaned quite heavily
on the latest HREF guidance for delineating shower chances over
the region. Activity may be a bit more widespread/scattered
along the MA/NH/VT border. 

Did nudge down temperatures from the previous shift with 925 hPa
temps ranging from 3-7 degrees Celsius. Expect this in
combination with the considerable cloudiness resulting in near
to below normal temperatures. Highs top out in the 50s for most,
but there may be a few spots across the southern Merrimack
Valley that get into the low 60s.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM TUESDAY/...
Highlights 

* Any diurnal showers tapering off during the evening. Could see
  some patchy fog develop late as skies clear and winds remain
  relatively light.

* Mix of sunshine and clouds on Tue. Scattered hit-or-miss rain
  showers during the afternoon. May be cold enough aloft that a
  few of the more vigorous showers produce graupel.

Cutoff low continues to rotate across the Great Lakes/Ontario
through this period. The core of the cutoff will be near the
eastern Great Lakes and could see a few hard to time shortwaves
rotating through. This will keep a broad low nearby/over the
region.

Anticipating that any of the diurnally driven shower activity
will diminish in coverage this evening. Should see sky cover
gradually clearing as the night progresses. Do have some
uncertainty in how much clearing occurs, which will impact how
low are temps are able to get. On top of this winds will be
relatively light given the weak pressure gradient. Could see
some patchy fog formation especially given the recent rains. At
this point went with the 50th percentile of guidance for lows.
If we can radiate a bit more than currently anticipating we may
see a few spots getting into the low/mid 30s, which could result
in patchy frost. There are a few spots across our CWA where a
Frost Advisory may be necessary, but confidence was not high
enough to include in the latest update. 

Expect considerable cloudiness on Tue with a -20 to -30 degree
Celsius cold pool overhead at 500 hPa. This in combination with
any heating will result in an abundance of cloud cover,
especially during the afternoon. Will have a bit more mid level
moisture to work with, so am anticipating that shower activity
will be a bit more widespread. Given the cold temps aloft think
that any of the more vigorous showers that develop could produce
graupel. Have not added to the current forecast, but do want to
mention given the current setup. Fortunately think for most it
will be dry, but more of a hit-or-miss shower day. High
temperatures still near to below seasonable with readings in the
50s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
230 AM UPDATE:

Highlights...

* Cool weather pattern with lots of diurnal clouds and 
  isolated/scattered showers thru Thu, but by no means a washout

* Drier Friday and Saturday but likely remaining slightly cooler 
  than normal

* Cool/unsettled pattern likely returns Sunday and or early next 
  week (first week of May!)

Synoptic Overview...

Omega block from the Great Lakes to east of Newfoundland will yield 
an unsettled weather pattern thru about Thu, featuring cool 
temperatures, lots of diurnal clouds and isolated/scattered showers. 
By no means a washout with many hours of dry weather, but an 
extended period of cool temps and more clouds than sunshine. Driest 
stretch of weather may come Fri/Sat, as upper air pattern retrogrades 
a bit with ridging setting up over New England. However this will be 
temporary as teleconnections transition to another cool/unsettled 
regime. This is in response to high latitude blocking featuring a 
negative NAO along with upstream positive PNA/negative EPO. 

Precipitation...

Cyclonic flow and cold temps aloft will yield isolated to widely 
scattered diurnal showers daily through Thursday. Again, not a 
washout with many hours of dry weather each day. Highest 
probabilities for showers will be well inland (proximity to cold 
pool aloft), with lowest probability of showers across Cape Cod and 
the Islands. Driest period of weather may come Fri into Sat, as 
upper air pattern retrogrades a bit placing ridge axis over or near 
New England. Although, this is temporary as next chance of 
widespread rain comes at the end of this forecast period, as 
impressive negative height anomaly per ensembles sets up over the 
Great Lakes and OH Valley. This sets up a moisture plume off the 
Atlantic into New England of +1 to +2 sigma, notable for this time 
range. Given the high latitude blocking, this could be a slow 
moving, and possibly high impact event with heavy rain potential 
Sunday and/or Monday. Ensemble situational awareness tables for both 
ECENS & NAEFS both indicating anomalies up to +/- 2.5 Sunday/Monday, 
impressive given the time range. We will need to watch 
ensemble trends as the week progresses.  

Temperatures...

Cool weather regime thru Thu with cold air aloft combined with more 
diurnal clouds than sunshine, along with isolated to widely 
scattered showers only yielding highs most days 55-60. Normal splits 
for this time of year are highs 60-65, lows 40-45. So only slightly 
cooler than normal, but clouds & scattered showers will accentuate 
the cool conditions. Dry weather Fri and Sat doesn't provide much 
additional warmth, with 1025 mb maritime high likely only yielding 
highs in the upper 50s to lower 60s. Closer to normal but probably 
slightly cooler than average, especially near shore given afternoon 
seabreeze potential.  By Sunday, onshore flow and increasing risk of 
showers likely keeps highs in 55-60 range once again.

.AVIATION /15Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
Forecaster Confidence Levels:

Low - less than 30 percent. 
Medium - 30 to 60 percent. 
High - greater than 60 percent.

15z TAF Update: 

Today: High confidence in TAF/trends but moderate on timing. 

Generally MVFR-VFR with stratus dispersing toward a SCT-BKN
stratocu for most; continued IFR-based stratus for the South 
Coast, Cape and Islands may take longer to scatter/disperse than
further inland but even here, we should see conditions 
transition toward at least MVFR. 

Light W to NW winds today; may see a sea-breeze/110-120 deg
winds develop at BOS around 17z, if it develops it may be
shorter lived (thru 20z?) but will reassess.

Today...High confidence in trends, moderate in exact 
timing.

VFR across CT with MVFR to IFR elsewhere with stratus. Should
see this stratus eroding/lifting as a dry slot punches in. This
will gradually lift ceilings to VFR levels by late AM/early
afternoon. Could see an isolated shower across the interior
during the afternoon. Have included a VCSH mention at BED/ORH,
but less certain elsewhere. Winds out of the W to NW at 5-10
kts. Eastern areas will see a sea breeze develop around 15-17Z. 

Tonight...Moderate confidence.

VFR, but would not be surprised if there is some patchy
radiation fog formation given the relatively light NW flow. At
this point confidence not high enough to include in TAF, but
will need to re-evaluated by later shifts.

Tuesday...High confidence.

VFR with increasing mid clouds due to diurnal heating. Should
see ceilings around 4-6 kft and fairly widespread scattered rain
shower activity. W to NW winds around 5 kts. Localized sea
breezes across eastern areas developing around 15-17Z once
again.

KBOS Terminal...High confidence in TAF. MVFR to SCT/BKN VFR
bases today. Possible sea-breeze around 16-18z, a bit uncertain
how long it would last; it may be shorter-lived thru 20z or
continue thru sundown.

KBDL Terminal...High confidence in TAF. MVFR bases become BKN
VFR by 16z.

Outlook /Tuesday Night through Friday/... 

Tuesday Night through Wednesday: VFR. Slight chance SHRA.

Wednesday Night: Mainly VFR, with local MVFR possible. Slight
chance SHRA.

Thursday: VFR. Chance SHRA.

Thursday Night through Friday: VFR.

&&

.MARINE...
Forecaster Confidence Levels:

Low - less than 30 percent.
Medium - 30 to 60 percent.
High - greater than 60 percent.

Small Craft Advisory remains in place for the southern outer
waters today and through tonight for the eastern waters due to
elevated seas. 

Today...High confidence.

Winds shift to the SE across the eastern waters at 5-10 kts,
while the southern waters see WSW to SW winds at 10-15 kts. This
is a result of a cold front slowly moving through. Seas 1-3 ft
across the inner waters and 3-6 ft across the outer waters.

Tonight...High confidence.

Cold front finally crosses the waters tonight. Will see winds
shifting to the WNW/NW with speeds of 5-10 kts. Seas 1-3 ft
across the inner waters and 3-5 ft across the outer waters.

Tuesday...High confidence.

Broad low remains in place nearby/over the region. The result
will be light and variable winds. Could see a few rain showers
moving into eastern areas during the afternoon. Seas 2-4 ft.

Outlook /Tuesday Night through Friday/... 

Tuesday Night: Winds less than 25 kt. Seas locally approaching
5 ft. 

Wednesday through Wednesday Night: Winds less than 25 kt. 

Thursday: Winds less than 25 kt. Slight chance of rain showers.

Thursday Night: Winds less than 25 kt. 

Friday: Winds less than 25 kt. Seas locally approaching 5 ft.

.HYDROLOGY...
Smaller rivers and streams have crest and are receding. For the
rest of the night we will continue to monitor the Farmington 
River in Simsbury as forecast show levels continuing to rise and
approaching minor flood the smaller tributaries empty into the 
Farmington.

.BOX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
MA...None.
RI...None.
MARINE...Small Craft Advisory until 8 AM EDT Tuesday for ANZ250-254.
     Small Craft Advisory until 8 PM EDT this evening for ANZ255-
     256.
