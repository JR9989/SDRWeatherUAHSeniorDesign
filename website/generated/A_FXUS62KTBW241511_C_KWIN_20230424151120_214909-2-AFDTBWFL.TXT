Issued at 1104 AM EDT Mon Apr 24 2023

Current VFR conditions could deteriorate through the afternoon 
for most TAF sites as energy from the GUlf moves into the area 
aiding the development of showers and storms. Greatest chances for
convection will be along the interior and to the east. However, 
coastal sites could see a passing shower or thunderstorm beginning
around 20Z. Some storms could have strong gusts and the potential
for hail. Currently VCTS to account for most sites as models are 
hinting at showers and storms being less widespread, especially 
along the coast. We will be monitoring the situation and will be 
ready to update when necessary.
