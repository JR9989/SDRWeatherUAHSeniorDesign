.UPDATE...
Issued at 945 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

We had a frosty start to the day across Middle Tennessee and many
areas had brief freezing temperatures around daybreak. With a
generally cool pattern expected to continue as we head into May, 
we are not done with the threat for frost/freeze.

Mid morning skies were sunny and temps were rising through the
40s. We are expecting afternoon highs in the upper 50s and lower 
60s, which is around 10 degrees below normal. 

An update was issued to remove frost wording and adjust hourly
trends. Otherwise, the forecast is on track.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Wednesday)
Issued at 222 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

High pressure is centered just to our north this morning. Some 
mid level cloudiness is now pulling off to the southeast with 
clearing now in place. Current temperatures are in the upper 30s 
to near 40. Still looking at lows in the mid 30s range with small 
spreads and thus, frost potential remains. Have just reissued the 
frost advisory which will continue through 8 am this morning. 

For today, mostly sunny skies are expected as the surface high moves 
east. We will be a touch warmer today with highs in the lower to 
mid 60s. An early forerunner of an upcoming increase in activity 
will occur tonight as westerlies bring some mid level moisture 
across the area. This will act to keep our temperatures a little 
warmer tonight with most areas dipping to the upper 30s to lower 
40s. So, another frost advisory is not needed at this time. We 
could see some mid 30s though across our Plateau but that 
aforementioned cloud cover development will be an important factor
for them. 

It's looking a little warmer again for Tuesday. Still below normal 
though but we will see some upper 60s as heights attempt to rise a 
touch.  

Tuesday night will kick off a period of off and on unsettled weather 
for the mid state, as we go forward. The development of a close 
proximity 850 mb boundary will provide some forcing and isentropic
lift out ahead of a developing surface low over north Texas. 
Precip amounts into Wednesday look rather light with just a 
quarter inch or so of rainfall expected. This, however, will set 
the stage for a more active extended period.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday Night through next Monday)
Issued at 222 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

For the extended forecast, the previously mentioned surface low will 
move across the mid state on Thursday. Could be some tstm activity 
with it, but it will of course be track dependent. A shortwave on 
the back side could keep some light shower activity going into 
Friday. 

Pattern to remain unsettled toward the end of the week as a strong 
slug of upper level energy drops southeast across the midwest. An 
associated frontal system should bring some showers and a few tstms 
for Saturday. A strong upper trough with several shortwave axis 
depictions are indicated through the weekend. Hence, it could remain 
showery. 

QPF totals look like 1 to 1 1/2 inches Tuesday night through Friday. 
The heaviest qpf timeframe within that window looks like Thursday 
with the approach and passage of the surface low. Following this, 
the frontal system will bring an additional quarter to half 
inch over the weekend. 

For the extended temps, High temps will run a good 5 to 10 degrees 
below normal. Sunday or Monday could be even chillier than that 
depending on whether or not that deep trough scenario plays out. 
Look for low temps of 45 to 50 in general, so a little below normal 
there as well.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 649 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

CKV/BNA/MQY/CSV...Some BKN/OVC CI possible around 25/06Z-25/12Z, 
but with impacts to aviation operations minimal, did not break out
a separate FM grouping to address. Variability in sfc winds is 
still expected, but not enough also to break out an additional
FM group to address. Did raise overall wind speeds to around
7 kts with N/NE sfc winds continuing thru 25/12Z as sfc ridging 
influences and dry northwesterly flow aloft continue to prevail.
