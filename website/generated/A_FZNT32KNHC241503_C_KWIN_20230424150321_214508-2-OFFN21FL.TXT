Synopsis for the Gulf of Mexico

.SYNOPSIS...A dissipating stationary front extends from the Big
Bend area of Florida to off southern Texas. Meanwhile, a strong
line of convection is affecting the Bay of Campeche, moving
quickly eastward. However, the lightning activity has decreased.
The frontal boundary is expected to dissipate later today. Fresh
to strong east winds along and just offshore the northern
Yucatan Peninsula will diminish by early this afternoon, then
redevelop Wed night. Another frontal boundary will enter the NW
Gulf late this week but no appreciable increase in winds or seas
is forecast.
