.SYNOPSIS FOR THE MIDDLE TEXAS COASTAL WATERS...

Moderate to strong northeast flow between 20 to 25 knots will
continue today before decreasing to under 20 knots this 
afternoon. Winds are expected to shift to the southeast tonight 
and decrease to under 15 knots. Patchy light rain and isolated 
showers will be possible today and tonight across the local 
waters, with scattered thunderstorms possible Tuesday. A 
generally weak to moderate onshore flow will persist Tuesday night
through Wednesday night, followed by a shift northward on 
Thursday in response to an arriving frontal boundary. The front 
will bring a chance for isolated to scattered showers and 
thunderstorms to occur late Wednesday night through Thursday

continue through Friday morning, before gradually becoming onshore
in the afternoon. Another front is expected to arrive during the 
weekend with an offshore flow resuming once again.
