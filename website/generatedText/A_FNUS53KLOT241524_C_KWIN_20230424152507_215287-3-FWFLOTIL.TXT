Fire Weather Planning Forecast For Northern IL and Northwest IN
National Weather Service Chicago/Romeoville IL
1024 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

.DISCUSSION...
Temperatures will moderate into the low to mid 50s across the 
region today. The exception to this will be along the Lake 
Michigan shore, where a lake breeze will develop by early 
afternoon and limit temperatures to the 40s. Otherwise, mainly 
dry weather is expected beneath partly to mostly cloudy skies 
and with west to northwest winds 10 to 15 mph. Afternoon relative
humidity will drop to the 30 to 35 percent range. Clouds will 
thicken by tonight, with rain developing across much of the area 
which will persist into Tuesday. Areas south of the I-88 corridor
across northern Illinois and northeast Indiana will see the 
greatest rainfall, with up to two tenths of an inch possible in 
spots.

Moderating temperatures are expected mid-week, though we will be 
near to still slightly below average for late April. Daily lake 
breezes will also keep temperatures cooler near Lake Michigan, 
along with lower mixing heights there. The next chance of wetting
rain looks to be Friday into the weekend, also with a return to 
cooler weather once again.
