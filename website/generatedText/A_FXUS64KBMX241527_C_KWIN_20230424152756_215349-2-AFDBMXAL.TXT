(This afternoon through Tuesday)
Issued at 1020 AM CDT MON APR 24 2023

A few post-frontal showers continue across southeastern portions of 
the area, but very little, if any, rain is actually measuring. 
Clouds will decrease throughout the day with sunshine becoming more 
prominent area-wide by the afternoon, but temperatures will be 
seasonably cool due to a large area of high pressure moving east 
over the Ohio Valley which is providing northeasterly surface winds 
across Central Alabama. Highs will range from the mid 60s north to 
mid 70s south. Temperatures are likely to drop quickly tonight due 
to the dry and cool northeasterly flow, and a few pre-dawn readings 
in the upper 30s will be possible tonight across our north and 
northeastern counties with 40s elsewhere. There will be a mix of sun 
with some high clouds tomorrow, but we'll have one more day 
stabilized by the region of high pressure over the Ohio Valley with 
westerly flow aloft. Temperatures will trend slightly warmer, but 
still pleasant with highs ranging from the upper 60s north to near 
80 southeast.

Unsettled conditions remain forecast across our region mid to late
next week as a series of disturbances move through, and confidence
on this remains high Wed through Fri. Sat/Sun conditions appear 
to be less rainy/storm, through guidance suggests a large upper- 
trough/cold frontal passage on Saturday. Furthermore, it appears 
our chances for thunderstorms has seemingly increased, 
particularly for Thursday, after analysis of latest 00z guidance.

While flow aloft will be in a more zonal configuration across the
southern CONUS on Wednesday, guidance has become more suggestive
of a weak surface low developing somewhere across the lower
Mississippi Valley in response to an approaching shortwave trough.
This low pressure is currently progged to move northeast into the
Tennessee Valley while southerly low-level flow overspreads
Alabama. Increasing boundary layer moisture temporally overlapped
with afternoon heating is resulting in MUCAPE of <2,000 J/kg across
the establishing warm sector. Instability could be higher as most
guidance is showing 6.5-7.5 C/km mid-level lapse rates emanating 
from our southwest. With increasing forcing considerations
Thursday, owing to the approaching shortwave, and 40-50 kts 500 
mb flow, an environment conditionally supportive for severe 
weather is appearing more likely on Thursday with progged kinematics
supporting a supercell storm mode. I'll add this threat to the 
HWO for now, as low-confidence, until further details can ironed 
out in the coming days. For now, GFS/ECMWF forecast hodographs 
suggest the threat will primarily be large hail and damaging 
winds, though a tornado threat could also materialize if low-level
shear/hodograph curvature can increase. This system will move off
to our east by Friday morning.

I'm leaning toward more quiet conditions for Friday as we *should* 
be in a more subsident environment after the exit of the Thursday
system. However, a potent upper-level disturbance is progged to
move into the central CONUS Saturday morning with a trajectory for
the TN Valley/Deep South thereafter. This continues to result in 
additional rain chances, at least for Saturday, despite ongoing 
uncertainty regarding the synoptic evolution of the system.

(12Z TAFS)

Mainly mid level clouds out there, with some sprinkles and a 
brief light rain shower at best across the south through 13 
or 14z. Clouds will be on the decrease through the day, with 
northerly winds of 7 to 10 kts. Otherwise VFR conditions 
expected through the period.

.FIRE WEATHER...

Light northerly to northeasterly flow continues today, generally 
5-10 mph. Minimum RH values are forecast to drop to 25-30% this
afternoon. Winds remain light and easterly tomorrow with little
moisture increases. Rainy conditions are forecast by mid to late 
week in association with multiple disturbances moving through the 
region.
