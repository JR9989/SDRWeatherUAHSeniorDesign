.MESOSCALE UPDATE...
Issued at 1005 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

Rest of Today...Zonal flow aloft persists across the region today. 
High pressure centered over the Ohio River Valley will continue to 
settle into the forecast area today.  This will result in another 
day of overall pleasant conditions across the CWA as a cooler drier 
resides across the region.  Skies will continue to clear through the 
course of the day, as highs range from the middle 60s to around 70 
this afternoon with occasionally breezy northeast winds. 

The ongoing forecast for today is in good shape.  Other than some 
minor adjustments to hourly elements of the forecast based on 
current trends, no major changes will be made on this morning's 
update. /19/

.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 530 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

Today and Tonight:

Early this morning, our forecast area remains beneath the right 
entrance region of a departing jet streak. At the surface, the cold 
front associated with this departing system is draped along the Gulf 
Coast. As high pressure builds farther southward through the lower 
levels, mesoanalysis fields show weak cold air advection and some 
lower-level and mid-level frontogenesis sloping back to the north 
under the favorable jet dynamics. There continue to be weak returns 
on regional radars where some light precip is being generated from 
the mid cloud deck. Subsidence will become more dominant as the jet 
streak pulls out to the east today, and any sprinkles should die out 
by mid morning. Before then expect only trace amounts of precip. The 
dry air associated with the surface high will push afternoon RH 
values down to around 30 percent over the northern half of our area, 
so will maintain the "Limited" fire danger highlighted in our 
Hazardous Weather Outlook text and graphics. /NF/

Midweek: Mid level zonal flow will be draped across the Gulf Coast 
extending from S Texas to the FL Panhandle. However, southerly lower 
level flow looks to increase moisture, bringing rain chances back 
into the forecast on Wednesday. While QPF seems to be relatively 
low, the chance for an occasional heavy downpour or two can not be 
ruled out. A shortwave trough will enter from NE Texas bringing the 
possibly for some severe weather on Thursday. With steep lapse rates 
(around 6.5-7 C/km) and some pretty decent MUCAPE values (between 
2500 to 3000 J/kg), early model guidance shows the potential for an 
environment favorable for isolated severe storms. Being that we are 
still a couple of days away from this event, we will continue to 
monitor for possible changes. Highs will be in the mid-upper 70s for 
most of our CWA with some areas in the Pine Belt reaching low 80s. 
Lows will begin in the high 40s to low 50s on Tuesday, warming up to 
the high 50s to low 60s by Thursday. 

Friday through Monday: The previous trough will be exiting our 
region by Friday morning, although some showers may linger. Weather 
should be mainly quiet through midday, giving us only a short break 
as a long wave trough developing over the Central Plains makes its 
way eastward. At the moment, models are still debating on the depth 
of this trough with the ECMWF dipping this closed low down to 
Central MS. The severe potential seems limited due to lack of 
instability with the short recovering time in the mid levels as this 
system enters only two days after the Thursday front. Nonetheless, 
we will continue to monitor this system since we are a little less 
than a week away. Highs will be low to mid 70s for the weekend, with 
lows in the low to mid 50s. /LCP/
