.UPDATE...
Issued at 1016 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

Quick update to adjust today's temps, sky cover and PoPs for 
recent observed and model trends. Visible satellite shows stratus 
is backed well into eastern NM on moist SSE winds, although this 
is likely to begin eroding slowly towards the state line this 
afternoon as winds veer more SSW ahead of a surface trough. On 
the Caprock meanwhile, we should still see stratus thinning enough
by mid/late afternoon for highs to reach near 60, but highs were 
cooled a bit near the NM border as this window for heating looks 
much smaller per recent hi-res guidance.

Rain-wise, a narrow axis of light showers across the southern 
South Plains looks to continue on/off through the afternoon as 
steady isentropic ascent lingers around 295K, but measurable 
rainfall should prove spotty. Unless stratus can clear 
sufficiently in our NW zones this afternoon, chances for TS 
surviving their trek ESE from NM are looking less. Removed 
thunder mention in these areas for the afternoon as it appears 
this convection will stand a better chance of arriving closer to 
sunset, although with surface-based instability tapering by this 
time and not much elevated CAPE available, prospects for precip in
our NW zones this evening are looking even lower.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 331 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

Overall precipitation chances will not be spectacular today mostly 
because of a lack of large scale forcing. Moist isentropic ascent 
will continue to increase this morning. But this shallow lift will 
be under weak short wave ridging bringing some subsidence overhead. 
It remains to be seen if the weak isentropic lift would be enough to 
create light rain showers but chances are not great. However, there 
is a better possibility of drizzle underneath the low stratus this 
morning. Low stratus is expected to clear out in the afternoon as a 
very weak short wave trough approaches the area within westerly flow 
aloft. This short wave will only provide meager lift to the area 
this afternoon through early evening. A surface pressure trough will 
develop in eastern New Mexico this afternoon which may provide 
sufficient low level convergence for convective development. With 
skies expected to clear out west of the FA today, surface based 
instability will be able to develop with values only on the order of 
500-1000 J/kg or so. These values will rapidly decrease once in West 
Texas with much of the western South Plains still remaining in cool 
southerly to southeasterly flow. Severe storms are highly unlikely 
given the weak lift and instability present in the atmosphere. Cloud 
cover will keep much of the area much cooler than seasonal averages 
again with the coolest air off the caprock. Areas near the Texas/New 
Mexico state line will see some additional warming with anticipated 
decreasing cloud cover this afternoon. For tonight, moist isentropic 
ascent will again increase bringing possible very light rain 
showers.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Sunday)
Issued at 331 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

Unsettled weather is set to continue through midweek as a series of 
upper level disturbances transits over the region. A messy surface 
pattern will take shape on Tuesday as a warm front lifts slowly 
northward over the Red River as surface troughing deepens over NE
New Mexico and a dryline attempts to sharpen over the South 
Plains region. Early day warm advection rain showers are expected 
over the Rolling Plains and the SE TX Panhandle while cloud cover 
gradually clears over the SW Panhandle and South Plains as low 
level flow veers more westerly and begins eroding the low level 
moist layer. This reduction in cloud cover will allow temperatures
to rise into the lower 80s over the SW South Plains with areas 
off the Caprock expected to remain relatively cool through Tuesday
afternoon as cloud cover and moist advection continues. 

Things look potentially more active Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday 
night as stronger broad-scale forcing arrives ahead of a compact 
deep upper low diving SE-ward over the Four Corners. Guidance has 
come into better agreement in the evolution of this feature with 
most solutions bringing the low center a bit further southward 
compared to prior runs. The associated increase in upper level 
forcing combined with enhanced low level convergence associated with 
both the weakening warm front and a sharpening dryline have resulted 
in increased chances for thunderstorms Tuesday afternoon into 
Tuesday night especially across the far southern TX Panhandle and 
the northern Rolling Plains. There is still quite a bit of 
uncertainty regarding the timing of convective initiation and 
coverage late Tuesday mainly due to concerns about the longevity of 
what will likely be a fairly robust capping inversion. Nevertheless, 
steepening midlevel lapse rates and the presence of a healthy EML 
will likely result in MUCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg by 
Tuesday evening. Effective shear is more modest, but strongly backed 
surface flow behind the warm front lifting northward into Oklahoma 
suggest a few severe thunderstorms will be possible Tuesday evening 
into Tuesday night, especially over the far southern TX Panhandle. 
Blended PoPs were left largely intact Tuesday through Tuesday night 
given uncertainty of the positioning of surface features, but there 
will likely be a sharp cutoff in precipitation across the SW South 
Plains.

Shower chances will continue on Wednesday across most of the region 
as the upper low tracks over the TX Panhandle. Lingering instability 
and cool temperatures aloft will allow for a few additional 
thunderstorms however coverage in both storms and precipitation in 
general is expected to decrease quickly heading into Wednesday 
evening as a more stable airmass surges southward into the region. 
Thursday looks to be dry and mild ahead of the arrival of another 
cold front on Friday. Guidance has been trending faster with this 
front with Friday now showing good potential to be a breezy and 
relatively cool day. A few weak showers are possible behind the 
front Friday night mainly off the Caprock, but most areas will 
remain dry. Cool temperatures and a continuing northerly breeze 
continue Saturday before more seasonable temperatures return on 
Sunday.

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 616 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

Low CIGS will likely persist at all TAF sites for much of today.
Borderline MVFR/IFR CIGS at the moment are expected to drop into
IFR within a few hours as very light rain or drizzle expands
across the region. CIGS may improve this afternoon as
precipitation ends but a return to IFR is again expected tonight.
