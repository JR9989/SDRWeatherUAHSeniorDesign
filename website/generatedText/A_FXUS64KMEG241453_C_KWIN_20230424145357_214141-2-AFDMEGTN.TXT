.DISCUSSION...
(Today through Sunday)
Issued at 320 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

Temperatures across the Mid-South as of 3AM are in upper 30s to
low 40s, with the coldest areas along the Tennessee River in West
Tennessee. Additional cooling is expected over the next few hours as
skies remain clear and winds stay light. As a result, frost
development is likely across portions of the Mid-South. A Frost
Advisory is in effect until 8AM. By this afternoon, conditions
will be clear and cool with high temperatures in the low to mid
60s. 

Unfortunately, the dry weather is not expected to continue as a
shortwave approaches the region on Tuesday. This shortwave will
provide ascent across the region by Tuesday evening, allowing for
rain chances to return to the forecast. Soundings for Tuesday 
evening show a dry layer of air situated in the lower levels of 
the atmosphere. Therefore, onset of showers may occur later in the
night, but should be in place by Wednesday morning. QPF for this 
time will remain low as Precipitable Water values remain at and 
below the 50th percentile. 

By Thursday, a more robust upper level low will transverse the
region, keeping rain in the forecast. There are a few model
discrepancies on the trek of the low, but overall trends suggest a
very minimal severe weather threat for this time. Rather, the
bigger threat will be heavy rain as PWATs increase to around 1.3
inches, which is right at the 90th percentile for this time of
year. Rain showers and a few thunderstorms are expected to persist
through early Friday.

A brief dry period is expected Friday as a broad upper level 
trough approaches the region, eventually arriving by early 
Saturday. Thus, rain chances will yet again return for the 
weekend.
