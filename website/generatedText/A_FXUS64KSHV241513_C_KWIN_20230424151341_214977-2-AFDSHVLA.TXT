.UPDATE...
Issued at 1005 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

Partly to mostly cloudy skies continue near and south of the I-20
Corridor in the form of 5-10kft moisture. With the aid of solar
heating, should see this cloud cover begin to thin as we go
through the afternoon. East to northeast winds and the thinning
cloud cover will tend to limit daytime temperatures today of which
the current forecast has a good handle on. Did make some minor
adjustments to sky grids and hourly temperature grids but it will
not warrant an updated zone package for this morning. 

No update necessary this morning.

.SHORT TERM...
(Monday through Tuesday)

Weak subsidence from surface ridging overhead should be enough to
keep the forecast area dry today, but this ridge will move away
from the area late tonight setting the stage for the return of
precip chances tonight and into Tuesday. Mid-level moisture
remains pooled along a weak 850 hPa front, which will slowly lift
northward today. The persistent and relatively thick cloud cover
combined with weak low-level cooler air advection will keep
temperatures well below normal today. Most locations should warm
into the mid to upper 60s.

During the day Tuesday, a couple of weak disturbances in the flow
aloft will move across the Southern Plains ahead of an upper
trough digging through the Central Rockies. At the same time, a
surface low will rapidly develop over the High Plains of Southeast
Colorado/Northeast New Mexico. As a result, southeasterly surface
winds will return to most of the forecast area by Tuesday 
afternoon. Low-level warm air advection will quickly return along
with moisture from the Gulf. Much of the deterministic and 
ensemble guidance have become considerably less aggressive with 
precip across the area during the day Tuesday, so PoPs were
lowered somewhat from the 05z NBM values. Most of the widespread
showers will develop across Oklahoma and Arkansas closer to the 
weak disturbances passing overhead in a zone of warm air advection.

Of greater concern is the potential for severe convection that may
develop late Tuesday afternoon. Most of this activity should be 
west of the forecast area in North and Central Texas near a warm 
front that is expected to develop. Some of these storms could 
affect our western zones in Southeast Oklahoma and East Texas. 
However, there is a great deal of uncertainty. At this time, it 
appears the greatest severe weather threat will be west of our 
area, but storms moving north and east of the warm front into
Southeast Oklahoma and East Texas could become elevated and pose 
a threat for damaging winds and large hail.

(Tuesday Night through Monday)

A series of disturbances will maintain unsettled weather for the Ark-
La-Tex through the rest of the workweek. This is a result of zonal 
flow aloft that steers a shortwave and an upper-level trough (in 
that order) across the Great Plains into the area. The first of 
which will instigate chances of showers and thunderstorms through 
Wednesday, while the following trough will keep the precipitation 
going through Thursday. Paltry dynamics from the synoptic 
orientation of the trough will limit higher-end severe thunderstorm 
potential through the week. That said, the severe weather threat 
that is possible on Wednesday, due to adequate shear and lapse 
rates across east Texas, will involve the potential for large hail
while tornadoes cannot be ruled out. By Friday the next frontal 
boundary will be well on its way through the Ouachita Mountains 
into the Four State Region, ending the wet weather pattern in time
for the weekend. 

Precipitation/cloud cover will moderate temperature maximums into 
the 70s and minimums in the 50s (near average for this time of the 
year) with QPF total values of about 2 to 3 inches expected before 
calmer conditions arrive next weekend. Post-frontal temperatures 
after Friday will trend just below average before a gradual warmup 
by the beginning of the following week. /16/

.AVIATION...
(12Z TAFS)
Issued at 634 AM CDT Mon Apr 24 2023

VFR conditions will continue to prevail for the next 24 hours.
While most locations will continue to experience abundant mid
level clouds, some clear may occur north of Interstate 20 today
before more clouds rapidly move into the area from the west after
25/00z. Scattered showers, possibly a couple of thunderstorms,
could affect portions of Northeast Texas, Southwest Arkansas, and
Southeast Oklahoma after 25/06z. However, any convection that
develops is expected to remain north of the TAF sites through the
end of the period.
