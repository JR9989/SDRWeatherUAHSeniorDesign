After another frosty start to the day across the region,
temperatures should rebound nicely this afternoon into the mid to
upper 60s. Surface ridging that allowed for the last couple of 
cold nights will shift to the east today as a surface low deepens
in southeast Colorado. This will lead to increasingly gusty 
southerly winds this afternoon. Gusts of 25-30 mph will be likely
across much of northeastern Oklahoma this afternoon as vertical
mixing deepens throughout the afternoon. Increasing cloud cover
associated with an approaching shortwave will also spread over the
area this afternoon. A few light showers could also spread into
areas along and west of Highway 75 later this afternoon and
evening, but heavier more widespread precip chances will hold off
until overnight tonight into tomorrow. The going forecast for 
this afternoon is in good shape, with no major updates planned.

The main concerns with this forecast package center around the
high chances for widespread rainfall primarily during the Tuesday
to Wednesday night time frame. Heavy rainfall and localized 
flooding will be possible. The good news is some of this rain is 
expected to fall in areas to the northwest of I-44 that remain in 
severe drought.

As mentioned above, a shortwave moving through the flow aloft will
lead to showers this evening, focused across northeast Oklahoma. 
More isolated to scattered showers will be possible through the
night even into southeast Oklahoma and western Arkansas in
response to an increasing low level jet. Overnight lows tonight
will be noticeably warmer than this morning's due to the
increasing cloud cover and increasing low level moisture.

Tuesday will just be a raw day for late April, with highs across
much of the area running 15 to 20 degrees below normal given the
widespread rainfall expected during the day. Another shortwave 
and resulting warm advection will move through the area, causing 
the additional rainfall. Elevated instability will increase 
through the day, especially across southern portions of the area, 
which could lead to a few strong to severe storms featuring a hail
threat.

The main upper level system will make its approach Wednesday and
into Wednesday night. As the system swings into the Texas
Panhandle, a front to our south will begin to move northward as a
warm front, but at this time, it appears that it will stay south 
of the area. However, with its approach, elevated instability
looks to increase further across areas south of I-40 by Wednesday
afternoon, leading to a slightly higher potential for strong to
severe storms, especially along the Red River. Hail remains the
main threat. The heavier rains Wednesday and Wednesday night will
focus along and north of the front, as well as following the track
of the upper low. With some uncertainty remaining in the locations
of both features, expect there to be some fine tuning of amounts
in the next day or so, including potential for increasing amounts
within the expected maxima as depicted in much of the
deterministic guidance.

The rains will taper off from west to east Thursday as the upper
low sweeps east of the area. Temperatures will remain below normal
Thursday, albeit a bit warmer than Tuesday and Wednesday due to
a bit more sun and less rain. Another storm system will move into
the Plains, dragging another cold front through the area Friday
and Friday night. Isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms
will also accompany this front. After a post-frontal cooldown
Saturday, warmer but still below normal conditions can be expected
to close out the weekend and begin the next work week.

VFR conditions are expected to prevail through the valid period 
at all area sites. However, ceilings will begin to lower this 
evening and into the overnight hours. Scattered showers will also 
have the potential to impact area sites late in the period.
